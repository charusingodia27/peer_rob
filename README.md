Two Robot MPC Simulation in Gazebo
This project demonstrates how to spawn and simulate two robots in the Gazebo environment using ROS Noetic. The robots are described using URDF files, and their states are published with robot_state_publisher.

Features
Spawns two robots in Gazebo.
Utilizes URDF to describe the robots.
Uses robot_state_publisher for joint states.
Easy-to-follow setup and launch.

üìã Prerequisites
Install ROS Noetic
Follow the official ROS installation guide.
Install Required ROS Packages
Install necessary dependencies:
    sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-robot-state-publisher ros-noetic-gazebo-ros

Set Up Your Workspace
Create and configure your catkin workspace:
    mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
    cd ~/catkin_ws/
    catkin_make
    source devel/setup.bash

This project focuses on integrating YOLO inference with ROS 2, enabling seamless object detection capabilities for robotics applications. The development process involved leveraging Google Colab for training and inferencing due to hardware limitations, as my laptop does not support GPU acceleration. Below are the key steps and accomplishments:

Training and Inferencing:

The YOLO model was trained and tested on Google Colab, utilizing its GPU resources to expedite the process.
Model inferencing was also successfully executed on Colab, ensuring the effectiveness of the trained model.
ROS 2 Node Development:

A dedicated ROS 2 node was developed to integrate YOLO inference using Ultralytics YOLOv5.
The node is designed for real-time object detection in robotics systems.
TensorRT Conversion:

An attempt was made to convert the trained model to TensorRT for optimized deployment.
Due to resource limitations on my laptop, this step could not be completed locally. However, TensorRT conversion remains a prospective enhancement for deployment on edge devices.
This repository provides the ROS 2 node code, along with instructions for reproducing the training and inferencing setup on Google Colab.
